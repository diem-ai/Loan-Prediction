# Loan's Approval Prediction
 - Implement a classification model to predict whether or not a loan application is approved using **Decision Tree Classifier**
 - Explore various techniques for preventing overfitting in decision trees
 - Apply **undersampling** and **ensemble methods (bagging, boosting)** to combat the **imbalanced dataset**
 - Find out the best parameters for each classifier with gridsearch
 - Compare the optimized models with baseline models
 - Evaluate models with accuracy score, precision, recall and F1-score
 
 # Steps
 - Load dataset into pandas dataframe
 - Explore features and select the relavant ones to train model
 - Analysis the proportion of safe and risky loan in dataset
 -
